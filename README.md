# Deepfake Classification competition on Kaggle

## Overview
This is an image classification challenge in which competitors train classification models on a data set containing deepfake images generated by deep generative models. Competitors are scored based on the classification accuracy on a given test set. For each test image, the participants have to predict its class label.

## Task
Participants have to train a model for deep generated image classification. This is a multi-way classification task in which an image must be classified into one of five classes.

The training data is composed of 12,500 image files. The validation set is composed of 1,250 image files. The test is composed of 6,500 image files.

## File Descriptions
- train.csv - the training metadata file containing the training image file names and the corresponding labels (one example per row)
- validation.csv - the validation metadata file containing the validation image file names and the corresponding labels (one example per row)
- test.csv - the test metadata file containing only the test image file names (one sample per row without label)
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

## Data Format

### Metadata Files

[![Download Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Data-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/mateiungureanu/Deepfake-Classification/releases/tag/v1.0)

The metadata files are provided in the following format based on comma separated values:

```
image_id,label
532de967-c8fb-49a6-9a8c-3c32cfa93d3e,0
c0519e94-1422-405c-a847-ce726f4a13cf,2
13a99838-2919-4b79-b9fd-bce8f0e59e09,2
...
```

Each line represents an example where:

- The first column shows the image file name of the example.
- The second column is the label associated to the example.

### Image Files
The image files are provided in .png format.



## Rules

### No extra data or models
Using additional data, pre-defined models or pre-trained models is not allowed.

Failure to comply will result in disqualification.

### Project Report
Your grade will be given only if you provide the code and a documentation for your proposed approach. The report should follow these guidelines:

- The description of your machine learning approaches including the chosen feature set (color histograms, etc.), the tested models (K-NN, SVM, etc.). Details should also include data preprocessing / augmentation, feature representation and details / proof (via tables / figures) of hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, performance function, regularization, etc.). A minimum of 3 pages (excluding tables and figures) is expected. Documenting all the tried approaches (even unsuccessful ones) is a must. (required)
- Documenting and using at least two different machine learning models is required.
- Report confusion matrices for the provided validation set with various models. Use tables / figures to report these. (required).
- Present results with various hyperparameter configurations via tables / figures. (required)
- The python code of your model should include explanatory comments.
